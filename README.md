# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

# Live App Link : https://ml-movie-recommender-1hwg.onrender.com/

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It suggests movies similar to a user-selected movie by analyzing different features of movies such as **overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew (director)**.  

The system uses a **Bag of Words model with cosine similarity** to measure closeness between movies and recommend the top matches.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Dataset**
   Source : Kaggle TMDb 5000
   - The dataset contains around **5000 movies** with information like title, overview, genres, cast, crew, and keywords,votes,languages,etc.
   - Columns used for building recommendations:
     - `overview` → storyline/description
     - `genres` → movie genres
     - `keywords` → descriptive tags
     - `cast` → main actors/actresses
     - `crew` → director
    
2. **Data Loading and Inspection**
     
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Parsing JSON-like columns (`genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, `crew`) into structured lists.
   - Cleaning the `overview` column by removing punctuation, extra spaces, and unnecessary characters using **regular expressions**.
   - Handling missing values and empty lists (`[]`) by applying logical defaults.
   - Combining all important features into a new column called **`tags`**.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Text normalization (lowercasing, removing stopwords, tokenization).
   - Applying **Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)** to convert text into vectors.
   - Creating a **similarity matrix** using **cosine similarity**.

5. **Recommendation**  
   - For a given movie, the system finds **5 most similar movies** based on vector similarity (angular distance).
   - Recommendations are displayed instantly via the **Streamlit web app**.

6. 🎬 Frontend (Streamlit App)

   The frontend of this project is built using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

   - Users can search for any movie by typing its name into the input box.  
   - Once a movie is selected, the system fetches **top 5 similar recommendations** using the pre-computed similarity matrix.  
   - For each recommended movie, the **poster is retrieved dynamically** from [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), using the corresponding movie ID from the dataset.  
   - Results are displayed in a clean layout with movie titles and posters side by side for a smooth user experience.  

   This ensures the model’s results are not just textual but also visually engaging.

Here’s a breakdown of the important files in this repository:

- **app.py** → The main frontend built using **Streamlit**. It takes user input, fetches posters from the TMDB API, and displays recommended movies interactively.  
- **movie recommender system.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook containing the **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building** steps.  
- **movie_dict.pkl** → Serialized dictionary of movie metadata (used for quick access in the app).  
- **similarity.pkl** → Precomputed similarity matrix (using Bag of Words + Cosine Similarity) that powers the recommendation engine.  (built model)
- **requirements.txt** → Contains the list of required Python libraries for running the project.  
- **Procfile & setup.sh** → Deployment configuration files for **Heroku**.  
- **README.md** → Documentation of the project (you’re reading it!).  
- **mypic.jpg / mypic.png** → Images used for showcasing in the README or app interface.  

> Note: Other files/folders like `.idea`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, `.gitattributes`, and `.gitignore` are automatically generated and mainly used for environment/configuration.
